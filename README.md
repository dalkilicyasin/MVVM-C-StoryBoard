# MVVM-C Storyboard

Created simple project for developer if they want to use MCCM-C with Storyboard Coordinator Desing Pattern. And aslo combined with Alamofire Library for data parsing.

## Overview

MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) is a design pattern widely used in iOS/macOS development to achieve separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability. Alamofire is a powerful Swift-based HTTP networking library for handling networking tasks in iOS/macOS applications. Integrating MVVM-C with Alamofire and Storyboard-based navigation allows for a structured and efficient development process.

## Components

## Model
The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates data structures and methods related to the application's domain.

## View
The View displays the user interface and handles user interactions. It observes the ViewModel and updates its appearance based on the data provided.

## ViewModel
The ViewModel retrieves data from the Model and prepares it for presentation in the View. It contains business logic related to the presentation layer and interacts with the Model to fetch and transform data.

## Coordinator
The Coordinator manages the navigation flow within the application. It abstracts away the details of navigation and handles transitions between different screens. In a Storyboard-based architecture, Coordinators instantiate and present view controllers defined in the storyboard.

## Alamofire
Alamofire simplifies networking tasks by providing a clear and concise API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing authentication.


## Advantages

* Separation of Concerns: MVVM-C separates networking logic (handled by Alamofire) from the rest of the application, leading to more modular and maintainable code.
Testability: Each component in MVVM-C, including networking operations using Alamofire, can be easily unit tested, enhancing the reliability of the codebase.
Scalability: MVVM-C with Alamofire scales well with the size and complexity of the application, allowing for the seamless addition of new features and modifications.
Programmatic Navigation: Programmatic navigation simplifies the management of view controllers and their transitions, providing more flexibility and control over the navigation flow.
